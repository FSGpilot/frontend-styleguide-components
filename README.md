# POC version 1.0 - Frontend styleguide

This repo includes code for the proof of concept for a Frontend Styleguide based on [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/).
Based on USWD 6. july develop branch.

## Getting started

## Using the Standards

There are a few different ways to use the Standards within your project. Which one you choose depends on the needs of your project and how you are most comfortable working. Here are a few notes on what to consider when deciding which installation method to use:

*Download the Standards if:*
- You are not familiar with `npm` and package management.

*Use the Standards `npm` package if:*
- You are familiar with using `npm` and package management.
- You would like to leverage Standards [Sass](#sass) files.

### Download

1. Download the [Standards zip file](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/releases/download/v1.0.0/dkwds-1.0.0.zip) and open that file.

  After extracting the zip file you should see the following file and folder structure:

  ```
  dkwds-1.0.0/
  ├── css/
  │   ├── dkwds.min.css.map
  │   ├── dkwds.min.css
  │   └── dkwds.css
  ├── fonts/
  ├── html/
  └── js/
      ├── dkwds.min.js.map
      ├── dkwds.min.js
      └── dkwds.js

  ```

2. Copy these files and folders into a relevant place in your project's code base. Here is an example structure for how this might look:

  ```
  example-project/
  ├── assets/
  │   ├── dkwds-1.0.0/
  │   ├── stylesheets/
  │   ├── images/
  │   └── javascript/
  └── index.html
  ```

  You'll notice in our example above that we also outline a `stylesheets`, `images` and `javascript` folder in your `assets` folder. These folders are to help organize any assets that are unique to your project.

3. To use the Standards on your project, you’ll need to reference the [CSS (*C*ascading *S*tyle *S*heets)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and JavaScript files in each HTML page or dynamic templates in your project.

  Here is an example of how to reference these assets in your `index.html` file:

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title>My Example Project</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/uswds-1.0.0/css/uswds.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>

    <script src="assets/uswds-1.0.0/js/uswds.min.js"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

We offer both files, the CSS and the JavaScript, in two versions — a minified version, and an un-minified one. (In the examples above, we are using the minified files.) Use the minified files in a production environment or to reduce the file size of your downloaded assets. And the un-minified files are better if you are in a development environment or would like to debug the CSS or JavaScript assets in the browser.

And that’s it — you should now be able to copy our code samples into our `index.html` and start using the Standards.

### Install using npm

`npm` is a package manager for Node based projects. The U.S. Web Design Standards maintains a [`uswds` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uswds) for you to utilize both the pre-compiled and compiled files on your project.

1. Install `Node/npm`. Below is a link to find the install method that coincides with your operating system:

  - Node v4.2.3+, [Installation guides](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

  **Note for Windows users:** If you are using Windows and are unfamiliar with `Node` or `npm`, we recommend following [Team Treehouse's tutorial](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows) for more information.

2. Make sure you have installed it correctly:

  ```shell
  npm -v
  3.10.8 # This line may vary depending on what version of Node you've installed.
  ```

3. Create a `package.json` file. You can do this manually, but an easier method is to use the `npm init` command. This command will prompt you with a few questions to create your `package.json` file.

4. Add `uswds` to your project’s `package.json`:

  ```shell
  npm install --save uswds
  ```

The `uswds` module is now installed as a dependency. You can use the un-compiled files found in the `src/` or the compiled files in the `dist/` directory.

```
node_modules/uswds/
├── dist/
│   ├── css/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── html/
│   ├── img/
│   ├── js/
└── src/
    ├── fonts/
    ├── img/
    ├── js/
    ├── stylesheets/
    └── templates/
```

#### Importing assets

Since you are already using `npm`, the U.S. Web Design Standards team recommends leveraging the ability to write custom scripts. Here are some links to how we do this with our docs website using `npm` + [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/):

[Link to `npm` scripts example in `web-design-standards-docs`](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs/blob/develop/package.json#L4)

[Link to gulpfile.js example in `web-design-standards-docs`](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards-docs/blob/develop/gulpfile.js)

#### Sass

The Standards are easily customizable using the power of [Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)](http://sass-lang.com/). The main Sass (SCSS) source file is located here:

```
node_modules/uswds/src/stylesheets/uswds.scss
```

Global variables are defined in the `node_modules/uswds/src/stylesheets/core/_variables.scss` file. Custom theming can be done by copying the `_variables.scss` file into your own project’s Sass folder, changing applicable variable values, and importing it before `uswds.scss`.

Below is an example of how you might setup your main Sass file to achieve this:

```
@import 'variables.scss' # Custom Sass variables file
@import 'node_modules/uswds/src/stylesheets/uswds.scss';

```

You can now use your copied version of `_variables.scss` to override any styles to create a more custom look and feel to your application.

#### JavaScript
`require('uswds')` will load all of the U.S. Web Design Standards’ JavaScript onto the page. Add this line to whatever initializer you use to load JavaScript into your application.

### Use another framework or package manager

If you’re using another framework or package manager that doesn’t support `npm`, you can find the source files in this repository and use them in your project. Otherwise, we recommend that you follow the [download instructions](#download). Please note that the core team [isn’t responsible for all frameworks’ implementations](https://github.com/18F/web-design-standards/issues/877).

If you’re interested in maintaining a package that helps us distribute the U.S. Web Design Standards, the project’s build system can help you create distribution bundles to use in your project. Please read our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#building-the-project-locally-with--gulp-) to locally build distributions for your framework or package manager.


## Fractal

We're using [Fractal](http://fractal.build) to generate an interactive component library for the Standards. You can run it locally after `npm install` with:

```sh
npm start
```

Then, visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the Standards in action.

_**Optional**: To re-build when code changes are made, run the following command from the project directory in a separate terminal window:_
```sh
npm run watch
```

### Template compatibility

Many of our Fractal view templates are compatible with [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) (for JavaScript/Node), [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/) (Python), and [Twig](https://twig.sensiolabs.org/) (PHP) out of the box. Components that reference other components use a Fractal-specific `{% render %}` tag that will either need to be implemented in other environments or replaced with the appropriate `{% include %}` tags.

## Reuse of open-source style guides

Much of the guidance in the U.S. Web Design Standards leans on open source designs, code, and patterns from other civic and government organizations, including:

* Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s [Design Manual](https://cfpb.github.io/design-manual/)
* U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s [Design Patterns](http://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/)
* Healthcare.gov [Style Guide](http://styleguide.healthcare.gov/)
* UK’s Government Digital Service’s [UI Elements](http://govuk-elements.herokuapp.com/)
* Code for America’s Chime [Styleguide](https://github.com/chimecms/chime-starter)
* Pivotal Labs [Component Library](http://styleguide.cfapps.io/)
